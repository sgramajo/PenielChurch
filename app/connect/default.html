<h2>You fit right in!</h2>
<div><p>There are many ways you can connect in the Revival at Peniel Christian Church. The first way to connect to the vision God has given Peniel Christian Church is through Small Groups. Congregational Care, Evangelism and Discipleship are needed in our daily lives. And in the church, it's crucial. People of similar interests meet for Bible study, projects, and social activities. In Peniel Christian Church, we believe relationships need to be real and relevant for all age groups. We need each other for encouragement, growth and accountability.
</p><p>You have an opportunity to also learn more about the ministries that best fit your life stage, from kids ministry via SPARKS KIDS, students to collegiate to young adults (20-30s) via LIFE UTH MINISTRIES, and even all other adults (30's+) via our MENS/WOMENS ministries. We invite you to best fit in to Gods plan with your life style!</p></div>
